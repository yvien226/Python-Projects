# BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion case study
Based on the kaggle competition: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bigquery-geotab-intersection-congestion)

Geotab launched a Kaggle competition to challenge data scientists to help city planners and governments to forecast traffic hot spots ahead of time and reduce the stop-and-go stress of millions of commuters. The main task is to predict congestion based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times at each intersection in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia. 

In the first step, I explored the datasets given by BigQuery using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The script can be found in this folder. 

The next step is to build a prediction model.
