# BigQuery Geotab Intersection Congestion case study
Based on the kaggle competition: [link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bigquery-geotab-intersection-congestion)

Geotab launched a Kaggle competition to challenge data scientists to help city planners and governments to forecast traffic hot spots ahead of time and reduce the stop-and-go stress of millions of commuters. The main task is to predict congestion based on an aggregate measure of stopping distance and waiting times at each intersection in 4 major US cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago & Philadelphia. 

In the first step, I explored the datasets given by BigQuery using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The script can be found in this folder.

Further analysis on the traffic patterns would still be required to fully understand the transport demand before coming up with ways to better manage the issue and build a prediction model.
